# TimeSeries-StockMarket

A Python-based project for analyzing and forecasting stock prices using time series models. This repository implements ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models to predict stock market trends, complete with data visualization, model evaluation, and modular code for easy extension.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project demonstrates various time series forecasting techniques applied to stock market data. It includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, seasonality, and stationarity.
- **Model Implementation**:
  - **ARIMA/SARIMA**: Classical statistical models for univariate time series forecasting.
  - **Prophet**: A forecasting tool designed for time series with daily observations that display patterns on different time scales.
  - **LSTM**: A deep learning approach suitable for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- **Visualization**: Plotting actual vs. predicted values, residuals, and performance metrics.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
